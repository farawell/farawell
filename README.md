### HiðŸ‘‹ I'm John Park
Iâ€™m currently an undergraduate researcher at Robust Intelligence and Robotics (RIRO) Laboratory at KAIST CS, under the guidance of Professor Daehyung Park. I'm currently participating in a research about intelligent robot path planning. But my research interests are broad, including TAMP(Task and Motion Planning), AI Vision, HRI(Human Robot Interaction), and LMMs(Large Multimodal Models), and behavior trees.
